# To-do
- Sprint jumping = 5 block jump
- Scrolling
- Stop skidding animation from being canceled
- Fix glitchy large hitboxes
- Fix vertical goomba collisions
- More relaxed goomba kill (a small second hitbox rather than only the very top)
- Stop turning around skidding 
- Make it easier to do the smallest jump
- Better acceleration physics
    - Too slow to accelerate
    - Too slippery
- Can't run & jump
- Running not playing animation
- Finish [object Animation] when canceled

# Glitches
- Stalling in mid-air
